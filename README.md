# Hi there! 🙋‍♂️

Hi, I'm Jeffrey! 👋

I'm a manufacturing technician with experience in PCB rework, currently expanding my skills in Python and software development. My background includes hands-on work with electronics, data analysis, and problem-solving in technical environments.

After taking a break from data analysis, I’m now focused on strengthening my coding abilities, with the goal of transitioning into software engineering. I’m currently part of the ARK Apprenticeship Program, where I continue to learn and grow in the field of electronics and engineering.

I'm passionate about learning, problem-solving, and leveraging my technical background to build software solutions. Open to new opportunities, collaborations, and projects that push me further in my journey toward software development!
